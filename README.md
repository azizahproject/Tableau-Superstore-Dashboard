### 📈 Superstore Dashboard
Hi! I'm Azizah 👋 and this is my first data project using **Tableau**.

This dashboard explores sales and profit performance data through clean and interactive visualizations. It summarizes key metrics, highlights trends, and gives business users a quick understanding of customer segments, product performance, state contribution, and overall sales and profit patterns.

### 🔍 Project Overview
- Tool used: **Tableau**
- Data: [Superstore Dataset](https://github.com/azizahproject/Tableau-Superstore-Dashboard/tree/main/0_Resources/Dataset)
- Focus: Sales trends, segmentation, top-performing products

I created this as a personal learning project to build my data visualization skills and kickstart my portfolio. I'm excited to share it, and I hope it can be insightful or inspiring for others!

✨ Feel free to connect if you're also learning or working with data!
